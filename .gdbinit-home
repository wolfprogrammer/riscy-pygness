# This (.gdbinit-home) is a sample GDB configuration file.
# Copy it to your home directory and rename it to .gdbinit

# It holds the settings common to all your GDB sessions.  Put a
# separate .gdbinit file in each of working directory where you can
# put additional settings specific to that directory.

# Note, start this within Emacs as
#  M-x arm-elf-gdb --annotate=3

# This .gdbinit file is in the home directory.  It is always read
# first.  Here we put only common settings.  We also use a .gdbinit
# file in each working directory which is specific to the particular
# project.
